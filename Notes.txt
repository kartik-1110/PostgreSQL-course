Note: 
* This represents heading.
==> this represents syntax.
//Eg : this represents example.


* To create a database
==> CREATE DATABASE <name>


* To create a table
==> CREATE TABLE table-name(
    column name + data type + constraints if any
);
//Eg : CREATE TABLE person (
    id INT,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    gender VARCHAR(7),
    date_of_birth TIMESTAMP
);


* Insert values in table
==> INSERT INTO table-name(exact column names)
    VALUES ("Values to be inserted");

//Eg: INSERT INTO person(first_name, last_name, gender)
      VALUES ("Anne","Smith","FEMALE");


* Order by
//Eg : SELLECT * FROM person ORDER BY country_of_birth ASC;
//Eg : SELLECT * FROM person ORDER BY country_of_birth DESC;


* Distinct
//Eg : SELECT DISTINCT country_of_birth FROM person ORDER BY country_of_birth;


* WHERE clause
//Eg: SELECT * FROM person WHERE gender = "FEMALE;


* WHERE and AND clause
//Eg: SELLECT * FROM person WHERE gender="MALE" AND country_of_birth = "Poland";


*Comparison operators
< , <=   Less than, Less than equal
> , >=   Greater than, Greater than equal
<>       not equal
=        equal to


* Limit, Offset and Fetch
//Eg: SELECT * FROM person LIMIT 10;
//Eg: SELECT * FROM person OFFSET 5 LIMIT 10;
//Eg: SELECT * FROM person OFFSET 5 FETCH FIRST 5 ROW ONLY;


* IN
//Eg : SELECT *FROM person WHERE country_of_birth IN ("China", "Brazil", "Poland");


*BETWEEN - Select data from a range
//Eg: SELECT * FROM person WHERE date_of_birth BETWEEN DATE "2000-01-01" AND "2015-01-01";


*Like and ILike - match text values against pattern using wild cards
*ILike - is case sensitive
//Eg: SELECT * FROM person WHERE email LIKE "%.com";
//Eg: SELECT * FROM person WHERE country_of_birth ILIKE "p%";


* GROUP BY - group data based on column
//Eg: SELECT country_of_birth FROM person GROUP BY country_of_birth;
//Eg: SELECT country_of_birth, COUNT(*) FROM person GROUP BY country_of_birth;


* GROUP BY HAVING - count is a function
//Eg: SELECT country_of_birth,COUNT(*) FROM person 
      GROUP BY country_of_birth HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;


* MAX - Select maximumu from a column
SELECT MAX (price) FROM car;

* MIN - Select minimum from a column
SELECT MIN (price) FROM car;


* AVERAGE
//Eg: SELECT AVG(price) FROM car;


* ROUND - rounding the value to nearest decimel
//Eg: SELECT ROUND(AVG(price)) FROM car;


* SUM - sum of values
//Eg: SELECT SUM(price) FROM car;


*Arithematic operators
//Eg: SELECT id, make, price, ROUND(price * 0.10, 2), ROUND(price * 0.10), 2 FROM car;


* COALESCE - to handle null values -- takes a column value and a string to display its value is null
//Eg: SELECT COALESCE (email, "Email not provided) FROM person;


* TIMESTAMP and DATES 
//Eg: SELECT NOW();                 Gives timestamp
//Eg: SELECT NOW():: DATE;          Gives date 
//Eg: SELECT NOW():: TIME ;         Gives time


* Adding primary key constraints
//Eg: ALTER TABLE person ADD PRIMARY KEY (id);


* Unique constraint
//Eg: ALTER TABLE person ADD CONSTRAINT unique_email_address UNIQUE(email);
//Eg: ALTER TABLE person ADD UNIQUE(email);                 in this postgres chooses column names


* Check constraint
//Eg: ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT gender_constraint CHECK(gender = "FEMALE" OR gender= "MALE");


* Delete records
//Eg: DELETE FROM person WHERE id=1;
//Eg: DELETE FROM person WHERE gender="MALE";


*Update records
//Eg: UPDATE person SET email = "ommar@gmail.com" WHERE id = 2011;


======================> With DELETE and UPDATE always use WHERE clause or else you will update entire table.


* Upsert -- on conflict update
==> INSERT INTO person (column1, column2, .....)
      VALUES (value1 , value2, ... )
      ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET email = EXCLUDED.email;


* Relations/ Foreign keys
-- Foreign key is a column that link primary key of another table.


*Exporting Files to CSV
//Eg: (SELECT * FROM person LEFT JOIN 
      car ON car.id = person.car_id) TO 
      '/Users/....csv' DELIMITER ',' CSVHEADER ;
